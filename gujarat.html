                <h1>The Tree Of Life</h1>
                <p>The Tree of Life is usually symbolised as a huge and bountiful tree that harbours its own ecosystem. Birds, insects, and humans flock to it for food and shelter. The deep roots of the tree represents the connection to the past, whereas the strong trunk portrays being grounded in reality. The tree of life motif can symbolise the interdependence of life forms on each other. The Tree of Life is one of the central motifs of Gujarat’s Rogan art.

                    Traditional art often portrays Peepal and Banyan trees as trees of life. Madhya Pradesh’s Gond art depicts the Mahua tree as the tree of life, as all parts of it are used by the community. </p>
