            <p>Moving forward toward the Ganga plains, Bihar presents the classic Bhagalpuri Silk Sarees.
                 Known for their lightweight and exquisite patterns, Bhagalpuri sarees are a
                  classic presentation of statement elegance. Whether youâ€™re attending a wedding or a 
                  traditional festival, a Bhagalpuri silk saree is sure to make you stand out from the 
                  crowd. The traditional dress of men from Bihar is the dhoti-mirjai and kurta.
