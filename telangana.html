                <h1>Mango: The King Of Fruits</h1>
                <p>Mangoes and Mango trees feature prominently in Miniature paintings. They depict prosperity, friendship, sweetness, and abundance. Artists would depict mango trees as auspicious omens. The Mughal emperor Jahangir enjoyed mangoes. Akbar even owned a grove of 100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga! There are allusions to ripe mangoes, mango season, mango groves, blooming mango trees, and the plucking of mangoes in the paintings of those times. Mango trees laden with fruit are an important motif in Cheriyal paintings as well, as we can see in the below painting by the artist Sai Kiran Dhanalakota.</p>
