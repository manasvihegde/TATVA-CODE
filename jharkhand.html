                <h1>The bird with a thousand eyes</h1>
                <p>The prideful peacock motif continues to evoke awe-inspiring emotions in the hearts of those who see it. Indian artists used peacocks to symbolise life, power, prosperity, knowledge, royalty, and beauty. Peacocks are sacred to Hindus, as they are the vahan (vehicle) of Lord Kartikeya. In Pichwai paintings, dancing peacocks that mimic Lord Krishna’s raas leela are used as a backdrop for Shrinathji’s idol during the monsoon season.</p>
