            <p>The traditional dresses of Himachal Pradesh are different for different tribes and vary
                 among both men and women as well.the dresses are made keeping in mind the harsh cold
                  weather during winters that linger almost throughout the year. The women usually wear
                   salwar kameez, Ghagras, and Lehenga Cholis. The costumes of women include colorful 
                   headscarves that are long enough and are knotted from the back.  Women also adorn
                    themselves with lots of bangles, and different types of traditional ornaments.
