                <h1>Fish: Bringing Waves Of Good Fortune</h1>
                <p>Fish is one of the Hindu zodiac signs. It symbolises fertility, abundance, and good luck. Fish thrive in fresh and clean water and thus were seen as symbols of wealth and prosperity. Fish scales are a common motif in Gond art. Madhubani paintings contain depictions of fish in pairs of two and represent the presence of the goddess Lakshmi. Aquatic themes feature in the Bhil art of Jor Singh, a contemporary Bhil artist and husband of Bhuri Bai.</p>
