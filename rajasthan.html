            <p> Bandhej or Bandhani is the oldest form of tie and dye. According to the historical references, the first Bandhani saree was worn many years back, at a royal wedding. Ajanta caves also have a visual representation of Bandhej and this ancient art form is still in practice. Bandhani is generally performed on cotton and silk fabrics. The fabric is tied tightly, and it is then dipped in for a dye bath. The tied area of the fabric is dyed in vibrant colors. Bandhej is a combination of a cluster of patterns, beautiful color combinations and alluring twirls. Wearing Bandhani  is a mark of identity in many communities. Bandhej is generally worn as a wedding outfit or on traditional occasions. Finer the Bandhani work, more expensive the fabric is. Bandhani is generally made up of natural colors where the main colors are yellow, blue, green and black.
