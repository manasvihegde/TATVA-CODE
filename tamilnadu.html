            <p>Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu has been one of the oldest and most eminent weaving centres of India for more than 1.5 Centenaries. This famous silk sarees craft of Kanchipuram are treasured for their rich and varied motifs. Kanchipuram is mentioned in the books of the Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali who lived in the 3rd â€“ 2nd century BC. Chinese monk Hiuen Tsang visited Kancheepuram during the reign of Pallava King Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century CE. He mentions an enormous number of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples as well as a flourishing weaving industry.
                The saris are woven from pure mulberry silk thread. The pure mulberry silk and the Zari used in the making of Kanchipuram saris comes from South India.To weave a Kanchipuram sari three shuttles are used. While the weaver works on the right side, his aide works on the left side shuttle. The border colour and design are usually quite different from the body. If the mundhi (the hanging end of the sari) has to be woven in a different shade, it is first separately woven and then delicately joined to the Sari. The part where the body meets the mundhi is often denoted by a zigzag line. In a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari, body and border are woven separately and then interlocked together. The joint is woven so strongly that even if the saris tears, the border will not detach. That differentiates the kanchivaram silk saris from the others.
