                <h1> Lotus: Symbol Of Rebirth And Creation</h1>
                <p>Artists associate lotus flowers with Lord Vishnu and Lord Krishna and use them to symbolise purity and beauty. Lotus flowers are also sacred in Buddhist depictions. The enlightened Buddha sits on a lotus with his legs crossed, i.e., in the lotus position.</p>

                   <p>Hindu mythology depicts the goddess Laxmi as well as Lord Brahma sitting on a Lotus. Lotus flowers are the meeting point of the earth, sky, and water and thus seem to represent the sacred union of life in Indian art forms.</p>
