            <p>Arunachal pradesh is known for their  vibrant handwoven skirts to gorgeously embroidered jackets, Arunachali outfits are a reflection of the region’s local diversity and skilled craftsmanship. A full-sleeved coat over a loose chemise is the traditional wear for women. Here, bamboo and silver accessories are worn commonly. The men wear silk shirts and pin the edges around the shoulder to secure. Their customary green lungis have colored stripes of blue, yellow, or white. The Sherdukpen men’s wear is famous for the skull-caps called Gurdam, which are made from Yak hair.
